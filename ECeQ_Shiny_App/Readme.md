# ECeQ shiny app

## About
 The interactive user interface is implemented using the R/Shiny framework, with powerful and convenient functions for processing and visualizing expression, CNV and eQTL data. Numerous open source bioinformatics analysis tools/pipelines are implemented with R, so ECeQ utilizes the R/Shiny framework to build the interactive web. All the R scripts used to develop the interactive web portal are freely available at github.com/omicscodeathon/eceq/Data_Analysis_pipeline.
