# Case study : The Brain-Blood-Barrier dysfunction 

To demonstrate the utility of the developed tool, we performed a study on the Brain-Blood-Barrier dysfunction in different neurological diseases ( HD, AD, ASD and  brain tumor) and in infectious diseases with neurological manifestation (SARS-CoV-2, TBEV, WNV, and Borrelia Garinii infection).


## The Brain-Blood-Barrier 
The blood–brain barrier (BBB), first described by Paul Ehrlich in the 19th century, is a unique dynamic interface between the peripheral blood supply and the central nervous system (CNS), controlling the transport of material to and from the brain (Ehrlich P. 1885). Considering the fundamental role that the BBB plays in maintaining brain homeostasis and protecting the CNS, it is understandable that dysfunctions of the BBB can be a trigger to the onset of neurological disorders and/or the worsening of brain disorders (Abbott, N.J. et al 2010; Kadry, H. et al 2020).

## The Brain-Blood-Barrier dysfunction
BBB dysfunction (BBBD) contributes to multiple issues including the extravasation of plasma proteins and immune cells into the brain neuropil, changes in astroglial functions, and potential entry of toxins, drugs, and pathogens into the CNS, which in turn, may lead to neuronal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration (Obermeier B et al 2013).
