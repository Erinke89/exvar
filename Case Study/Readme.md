# Case study : The Brain-Blood-Barrier dysfunction 

To demonstrate the utility of the developed tool, we performed a study on the Brain-Blood-Barrier dysfunction in different neurological diseases ( HD, AD, ASD and  brain tumor) and in infectious diseases with neurological manifestation (SARS-CoV-2, TBEV, WNV, and Borrelia Garinii infection).
