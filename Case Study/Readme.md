# Case study

To Demonstrate the utility of our tool, we performed a case study on Cerebral Malaria disease.

## About Cerebral Malaria 

The Cerebral Malaria infectious  disease susceptibility was studied using the developed pipeline for its validation. 
Malaria is an endemic disease, which affects about 219 million people, more than 241 million with 627,000 deaths in 2020 alone (WHO,2020). The Plasmodium genus of unicellular protozoan parasites are responsible for causing the disease in humans. Malaria can either evolve into simple or severe forms, the latter of which is a less frequent presentation of this disease.
Severe malaria is often defined as the presence of Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest. It is initiated when infected red blood cells (iRBCs) circulate to organs in the body and complications may involve the central nervous system (cerebral malaria), pulmonary system, renal system and/or hematopoietic system. Progression to these complications is often rapid and can lead to death in many cases (Luzolo, A.L., & Ngoyi, D.M. 2019 ; Bruneel, F. et al, 2019).
The host and parasitic factors causing CM are not yet fully elucidated and the transcriptome profile of P. falciparum isolated from patients with CM remains largely unknown. To complement this deficiency, we aimed to characterize the Genes associated with CM susceptibility at the level of the parasite genome and the human patient's blood cells. We then identified the CNVs associated with these geneâ€™s expression level regulation.
