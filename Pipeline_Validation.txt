# Pipeline validation

Pipeline validation was performed on publicly available datasets on SRA database, including:

- SRP074425 (Wang et al., 2016) and SRR24633043 (Choi et al., 2023) for Homo Sapiens,

- SRP428998 for Mus Musculus (Foreman et al., 2023),

- SRP091721 for Rattus norvegicus (Krebber et al., 2020),

- SRP310413 for Arabidopsis Thaliana (Fan et al., 2021),

- SRP310413 for Drosophila Melanogaster (Fan and Chen et al., 2022),

- SRP254020 for Danio rerio (Ai et al., 2022),

- SRP427377 for Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Sosa Ponce et al., 2023),

- and  SRP434916 (Zheng, 2023) for Caenorhabditis elegans.

## Note : 

All functions were validated using the analyzed data, except the CNVviz() function which was validated using simulation data for species other than Homo Sapiens.
