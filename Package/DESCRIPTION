Description: Enables easy and streamlined visualization of analytical
    functionality for biologists with limited computational skills. It supports
    alignment of FASTQ files to a reference genome, SNP, indel, and CNV calling,
    as well as generating gene count information and performing differential
    expression analysis. Additionally, it has built-in GUI functionality for
    visualizing these data.
