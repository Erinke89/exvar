## Motivation

RNA sequencing data manipulation workflows are complex and require various skills and tools. This creates the need for user-friendly and integrated genomic data analysis and visualization tools.

We developed a novel R package using multiple R packages to perform gene expression analysis and genetic variant calling from RNA sequencing data. The package could be used to analyze eight speciesâ€™ data. Multiple public datasets were analyzed using the developed package to validate the pipeline for all the supported species.

## About Exvar

The Exvar R package performs gene expression and  genetic variats (SNPs, Indels, and CNVs) data analysis and  visualization.

It is developed to facilitate and minimize the skills required for the genetic expression and variants calling. It includes 9 functions, providing an easy biologist-friendly workflow.

## Supported Species

It could be used to analyze data from eight species including:

    * Homo Sapiens (19, 37, and 38)

    * Mus Musculus

    * Arabidopsis Thaliana

    * Drosophila Melanogaster

    * Danio rerio

    * Rattus norvegicus

    * Caenorhabditis elegans  

    * and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.

## Installation

The package could be installed as follows:

    install.packages("devtools")

   lLibrary(devtools)

    devtools::install_github("omicscodeathon/Exvar/Package")

   lLibrary(Exvar)
