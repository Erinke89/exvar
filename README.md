# ECeQ: Shiny App for Gene Expression, CNV and eQTL data visualization

## About ECeQ
ECeQ is a biologist-friendly interactive interface that performs gene expression, genetic variation (CNV) and eQTL analysis and data visualization.
The ECeQ package could be used to perform one of the analyses or all of them simultaneously. The data visualization could be performed offline using the R studio software, or online using the  web app.

The developed R package is publicly available in the GitHub repository (github.com/omicscodeathon/eceq/R_ECeQ) and the Shiny web app is publicly available at (shinyapps.io/ECeQ).

## Case study
To demonstrate the utility of the developed tool, we performed a study on the Brain-Blood-Barrier dysfunction in different neurological diseases ( HD, AD, ASD and  brain tumor) and in infectious diseases with neurological manifestation (SARS-CoV-2, TBEV, WNV, and Borrelia Garinii infection).

## Abbreviations
ECeQ : expression, CNV and eQTL analysis 

CNV : Copy Number Variation

eQTL : Expressed Quantitative Trait Loci

ASE: Allele-specific expression
